# YouTube-to-MP3-Converter-Windows

This is a Youtube to MP3 converter for Windows, works for Youtube and Youtube Music

# Installation

This Youtube to MP3 converter will require FFMPEG which you can install [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), I would recommend you to watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1AtmY-RMyQ) YouTube video for installing FFMPEG for Windows, but if you already have FFMPEG installed and added to path then you don't need to worry. I will recommend to use Python 3.10.6 which you can install [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/), and you will need a Python module called "yt_dlp" which you can install with the code below. And enjoy!

```
pip install yt_dlp
```

# Features

- Uses FFMPEG to download the highest bitrate
- Can choose the preferred bit-rate
- Can download from Youtube or Youtube Music
- Can download single files or Playlists into one folder

NOTE: The section where it says to Enter File Name, you do not need to enter the file name since it doesn't work, because it automatically sets the name for you.
